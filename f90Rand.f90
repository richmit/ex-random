!
!  One of the new features of Fortran 90 was a standard random number generator.  The standard doesn't specify the algorithm used to
!  generate the numbers.  As one might expect, many implementations have quite bad generators that should never be used for serious
!  work.  The lack of standardization also means that one can not expect programs to have reproducible results on different
!  platforms. Still, the facilities are adequate for some non-critical applications, and they are always available.  On most
!  platforms the generator is seeded with the same value upon start up, so one will always get the same sequence from run to run.
!  We are lucky that Fortran 90 also came with a date_and_time() function that can be used to seed the generator.  Still, the system
!  clock may not have enough resolution to always render a different seed for different runs, so don't trust this method completely.
